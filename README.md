# min-max-heap

Since no max heap seems to exist for Python, here is a Min and Max Heap
implementation.

I just stood there, dumbfounded that there is no Max Heap for Python anywhere on
the internet. Seriously? In 2020? If you can find one, open an Issue and I'll
check it out.

### Performance

Absolutely no claims are made about the performance of this Min/Max Heap
implementation. I would just be glad that it exists at all ;)

That said, even the Python 3.8 standard library heap is implemented in [pure
Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/heapq.py).
